# BingoCard-Solved

CS1400 Class Assignment solved 

Bingo is a game where you are given a card with random numbers.  
There is a person calling out numbers.  
If one of those numbers match your card, you may cover it.  
As soon as you have 4 in a row, you call out BINGO!  In this program, you will implement a Bingo Card.  
There are no duplicate values in a Bingo Card.  You will create a 2D array of numbers to represent the card.  
The columns are labeled "B" (numbers 1–15), "I" (numbers 16–30), "N" (numbers 31–45), "G" (numbers 46–60), and "O" (numbers 61–75) .  
Note that the Letters BINGO do not need to be contained inside the 2D array. The numbers should be randomly assigned as you create the BINGO card.  
Hint: To avoid duplicate values in the card, you can create an ArrayList for each column with all the numbers possible.  
Remove a random value from the list, and put it into the Bingo Card.  Then remove that value from the ArrayList.  
Don't forget to set the Free space to 0.
